# Project Report

##Â Introduction 
We are building an interactive game in React that uses data from an API.

## Project scope 
- What are you not building?
We're not building a multiplayer game- our game currently allows one user to interact with it at a time. We're also not buiding a game that saves the user's score after they've refreshed the page. The game also doesn't limit the number of wrong answers the user can submit.

- How did you decide what features were important?
As we require fethcing API data, the feature we knew to prioritise was populating that data onto the UI. Following this, we needed a feature that allows users to input data in response to the API data.

# Requirement analysis 
How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?
Users can play the game using keyboard controls only.

# Project learnings 
- Did your team work effectively?

Given the issues that we had with project setup, we worked effectively. We used live share and pair programmed for the entire project.

What would you do differently next time?

# Recommendations and conclusions 
- What features would you prioritise to build next?
We would prioritise storing the user's score after the page is refreshed. We would also prioritise limiting the number of wrong attempts and possibly offering a range of answers for the user to pick from.

- Was the project a success?
The project is not complete yet, but we met all the requirements, so it was a success.
